# What is DNS?
A DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM(DNS) is first came to exist in early 1980’s. It represents a system of interconnected servers that store registered domain names and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

# Why we need DNS?

As the Internet grew, it became an unavoidable part of online interaction. The majority of internet users are not even aware of DNS and the huge favor it does us. Without DNS, you cannot access any website by typing a URL in your browser. 

When you want to visit a website, your computer needs to know the exact IP address; it does not care about the domain name.
DNS keeps the record of all domain names and the associated IP addresses. When you type in a URL in your browser, DNS resolves the domain name into an IP address.

# Who managed this domain name?

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) manages these domain names

# How Does DNS Work?

When you want to call someone using your cell phone, it is highly unlikely you punch in the exact phone number. Instead, you load the contact list and search using the person’s name. DNS does the same thing when you want to load a website.
Resolving a domain name or a hostname goes through several different phases.

# What is a DNS root server?

The administration of the Domain Name System (DNS) is structured in a hierarchy using different managed areas or “zones”, with the root zone at the very top of that hierarchy. Root servers are DNS nameservers that operate in the root zone. These servers can directly answer queries for records stored or cached within the root zone, and they can also refer other requests to the appropriate Top Level Domain (TLD) server. The TLD servers are the DNS server group one step below root servers in the DNS hierarchy, and they are an integral part of resolving DNS queries.

# What is an authoritative DNS nameserver?

The second type of DNS server holds a copy of the regional phone book that matches IP addresses with domain names. These are called authoritative DNS servers. Authoritative DNS nameservers are responsible for providing answers to recursive DNS nameservers about where specific websites can be found. These answers contain important information for each domain, like IP addresses,Like phone books, there are different authoritative DNS servers that cover different regions (a company, the local area, your country, etc.)

# What is a recursive DNS server?

When you type a website address into your browser address bar, it might seem like magic happens. In reality, the DNS system makes effortless internet browsing possible. First, your browser connects to a recursive DNS server. There are many thousands of recursive DNS servers in the world.  Many people use the recursive DNS servers managed by their Internet Service Provider (ISP) and never change them. If you’re a Cisco Umbrella customer, you’re using our recursive DNS servers instead.

# How to get domain name?
There are two main parts of Domain Name
* 1.Top-Level-Domain(TLD)
* 2.Second-Level-Domain(SLD)

# What is Top level Domain (TLD)?

TLD refers to the last part of a domain name. For example, the .com in amazon.com is the Top Level Domain. The most common TLDs include .com, .net, org, and .info. Country code TLDs represent specific geographic locations. For example: .in represents India. Here are some more examples
* com – Commercial businesses.
*	gov – U.S. government agencies.
*	edu – Educational institutions such as   universities.
*	org – Organizations (mostly non-profit).
*	mil – Military.
*	net – Network organizations.
*	eu – European Union

# What is Second Level Domain?
A second-level domain is what most people think of when they think of the name of a website. It’s the unique name that you choose to represent your brand because it’s the part that people will remember the most
